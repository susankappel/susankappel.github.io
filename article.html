This was the lesson Hofstra’s Counseling and Mental Health Professions Clinic (CMHP) taught at two Long Island schools where children were asked to send messages of love and support to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. The Parkland, Florida, school lost 17 students and staff members in a senseless 2018 shooting.</span><br><br><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: 0.03em;">As the first anniversary of the tragedy recently approached, CMHP Clinical Supervisor Susan Boxer Kappel met with the principals of the California Avenue Elementary School in Uniondale and John F. Kennedy High School in Bellmore. Kappel proposed an art project that would connect the schools with the Parkland community. Hundreds of students in each of the two Long Island schools would illustrate 6”x6” adhesive tiles with messages of friendship and support. Those tiles then served as the building blocks of two murals that were mailed to Parkland as part of an art exchange program.</span><div><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: 0.03em;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: 0.03em;">“How can we help others recover from a disaster? A community art exchange is an uplifting, positive, safe way to connect,” Kappel said. “Natural and human-made disasters have a profound impact, and those affected need to know they are not alone.”</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: 0.03em;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: 0.03em;">Kappel noted that John F. Kennedy High School has special ties to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High. “Students from both schools attend summer sleepaway camps in upstate New York like Chipinaw and Lokanda. This connection presented an opportunity to increase bonds between our communities.”</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: 0.03em;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: 0.03em;">Kappel’s right hand in this endeavor was Aimee Jette, a master’s student in Hofstra’s Creative Arts Therapy Counseling, who is president and CEO of Art in Common, Inc., a Connecticut-based 501(c)(3) that promotes creativity and increases community awareness around important social issues. Art in Common, Nonprofit helped provide funding for the murals.</span></div><br><div><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: 0.03em;">The tiles decorated by the Long Island students urged the Parkland teenagers to “Stay Strong,” “Have Hope,” and “Be the Difference.” Jette said she hopes the Stoneman Douglas community finds a small measure of comfort in the murals and in their heartfelt messages of friendship and compassion. "Often, when I see the students, they ask about the Parkland community. They feel connected in a way they didn't before."</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: 0.03em;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: 0.03em;">“We believe there is power in numbers and in being remembered,” said Jette. “This project also empowered the students here, teaching them that art can generate hope and aid in the healing process.”</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: 0.03em;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: 0.03em;">The artwork received a warm reception upon reaching Parkland. Kappel's contact reports making murals and banners with the squares, then delivering the pieces to the Stoneman Douglas Art Department. Students will be invited to create altered-books/flip-books incorporating the squares in a response in the school library's Maker's Space. The project was also shared with the local Bloomberg project advisory board, cultural and city leaders who were "all so touched and impressed."&nbsp;</span></div></div>
